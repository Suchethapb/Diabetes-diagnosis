DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM using C++ 
Project Image/Logo

Description
Developed an interactive diabetes prediction system that empowers users
to input relevant health parameters and receive an instant assessment of
their potential diabetes risk. By harnessing user inputs such as age, BMI,
blood pressure, and glucose levels, I designed a robust algorithm to predict
diabetes likelihood based on user inputs.
